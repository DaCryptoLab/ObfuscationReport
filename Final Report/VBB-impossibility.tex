\section{Impossibility of VBB}

In this section we formalize VBB obfuscators for Turing Machines and we sketch a proof of the impossibility result in \cite{VBB-imp}. We wil also discuss the impossibility of variants of the original VBB definition as well as the impossibility of applications of obfuscations.

\begin{mydef}[TM-obfuscator]
	A program $\Obf$ is an obfuscation if the following three conditions hold: % Complexity of O?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item (functionality) For every TM $M$, the string $\ObfM$ describes a machine computing the same function as $M$;
		\item (polynomial slowdown)  For every TM $M$, the description length and the running time of $\ObfM$ are polynomially larger than that of $M$.
		\item (VBB) For every TM $M$ and PPT $A$ there exists a PPT $S$ s.t. 
		$$ A(\ObfM) \indC S^M(1^{|M|}) $$
		where $\indC$ denotes computational indistinguishability\footnote{Note that in the definition in \cite{VBB-imp} the machine $S$ has oracle access to a polynomially bounded version of $M$. For simplicity, in this report we will abuse notation and simply write $S^M$ referring to a poly-time bounded oracle access. }.
	\end{itemize}
\end{mydef}

The definition above is the most general possible definition of TM-obfuscator: no adversary would be able to get effectively anything more from $\ObfM$ than what it could get from oracle access to $M$. We can increasingly weaken this definition by considering an adversary that, by accessing $\ObfM$, cannot effectively compute a witness $w$ s.t. $R(M,w)$ for any relation $R$, compute any function $f(M)$ or decide any predicate $\pi(M)$.


%It is possible to provide similar definitions for obfuscation of circuits \cite{VBB-imp}.

\subsection{TM-obfuscation is impossible}

To prove the impossibility of obfuscation we prove 

In the following we sketch the proof for a weaker result: that 2-TM obfuscation is not possible.

A 2-TM obfuscator is defined as a TM-obfuscator with the difference that ...

If VBB were possible [say about the difference between the representation and not]

[Proof]

It is possible to extend the argument above to TM-obfuscators by building a machine that composes the [two machines above]. [Analogous observations hold]
