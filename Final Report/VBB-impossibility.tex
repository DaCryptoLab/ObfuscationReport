\section{Impossibility of VBB}

\subsection{TM-obfuscation is impossible}
In the following we sketch the proof for a weaker result: that 2-TM obfuscation is not possible.

A 2-TM obfuscator is defined as a TM-obfuscator with the difference that ...

If VBB were possible [say about the difference between the representation and not]

[Proof]

It is possible to extend the argument above to TM-obfuscators by building a machine that composes the [two machines above]. [Analogous observations hold]

\subsection{Other impossibility results}
