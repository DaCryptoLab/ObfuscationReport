\section{Impossibility of VBB}
\label{sec:VBB-imp}

In this section we discuss the impossibility of VBB obfuscators for Turing Machines \cite{VBB-imp}. We will also discuss the impossibility of variants of the original VBB definition as well as the impossibility of applications of obfuscations.

%It is possible to provide similar definitions for obfuscation of circuits \cite{VBB-imp}.

\subsection{TM-obfuscation is impossible}

To prove the impossibility of obfuscation in the strongest sense (as given in the formal definition above) we can prove that a weaker definition is not possible either. In particular we will focus about an adversary that cannot compute effectively any predicate of $M$ when having access to $\ObfM$ (see discussion at the end of Subsection \ref{subsec:VBB}).
We will give an intuition of the original proof by proving that 2-TM obfuscators do not exist. Adapting the proof for TM-obfuscators is straightforward.

\begin{mydef}[(Predicate) 2-TM obfuscators ]
	A 2-TM obfuscator is defined in the same way as a TM obfuscator, except that the "VBB property" is defined as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item (VBB property) For every pair of TM $M_1, M_2$ and PPT $A$ there exists a PPT $S$ s.t. 
		$$ |\Pr[A(\Obf(M_1), \Obf(M_2)) - \Pr[ S^{M_1,M_2}(1^{|M_1|+|M_2|})]| \leq \negl(min(|M_1|, |M_2|)) $$
	\end{itemize}
\end{mydef} 

% Proof
The main idea behind the proof is that there is a difference between having oracle access to a function and getting a machine that can compute it. In the latter case we have a string on which we can do computations, possibly learning something from it.
We will then consider a function that cannot be learned by oracle access. Consider the Turing Machine
 $\function{UltimateAnswer}_q$, $\UA_q$ for short, that returns the 
 answer to the ultimate question $q \in \bit^k$ on "life, the universe and everything" \cite{adams}.
\[
\UA_q(x) =
\begin{cases} 
\hfill 42    \hfill & \text{ if $x = q$} \\
\hfill 0 \hfill & \text{otherwise} \\
\end{cases}
\]
Now consider another Turing Machine $\function{TestUltimateAnswer}_q$, $\T_q$ for short, which given in input a machine $M$ distinguishes whether it provides the answer to the ultimate question $q \in \bit^k$ or not:
\[
\T_q(M) =
\begin{cases} 
\hfill 1    \hfill & \text{ if $M(q) = 42$} \\
\hfill 0 \hfill & \text{otherwise} \\
\end{cases}
\]

% There is an adversary that can learn "a lot" even from obfuscation.
Consider a very simple adversary that given two (obfuscated) TMs as input simply runs the second TM on the first one, i.e. $A(M_1, M_2) = M_2(M_1)$. Having access to obfuscations of $\UA_q$ and $\T_q$ $A$ can clearly learn something. In particular, for any $q \in \bit^k$:
\begin{equation} \Pr[A(\Obf(\UA_q), \Obf(\T_q) = 1] = 1 \end{equation}

What can we say about what an arbitrary poly-time machine $S$ can learn from $\UA_q$ and $\T_q$ having oracle access to them? $S$ would not be able to pass the representation of $\UA_q$ as $A$ could. Also, it would be extremely unlikely for $S$ to sample the only point $q$ where $\UA_q$ does not return $0$. If we call $\Z$ the identically null function, we have:
\begin{equation} |\Pr[S^{\UA_q, \T_q}(1^k)] - \Pr[S^{\Z, \T_q}(1^k)]| \leq 2^{\Omega(k)}\end{equation}

On the other hand \begin{equation} \Pr[A(\Obf(\Z), \Obf(\T_q) = 1] = 0 \end{equation}
Combining $(1)$, $(2)$ and $(3)$ it is easy to show a contradiction.

\subsection{Other impossibility results}

% Circuits
The impossibility results for TM obfuscations also extend to other types of obfuscations.
In \cite{VBB-imp} the authors define \emph{circuit obfuscators}, the circuit counterpart of TM obfuscators. They also providethe following result:

\begin{mytheorem}
	If one-way functions exist, then circuit obfuscators do not exist.
\end{mytheorem}

% Unobfuscatable functions %XXX: Maybe, maybe not
% Approximate obfuscators
As discussed so far we cannot hope for natural, strong definitions of obfuscation to exist. We will now present results in \cite{VBB-imp} on weaker variants of obfuscations and potential applications.

One of the requirements we made in Definition \ref{def:VBB-tm} was that the obfuscated program should compute \emph{exactly} the same function as the original program. Could we obtain obfuscation if we relaxed our definition by allowing obfuscators to produce a program "approximately" the same as the original one?
The answer is negative. We can define an $\epsilon$-approximate obfuscator as one that returns on all inputs give the correct answer with probability higher than $1-\epsilon$ \cite{VBB-imp}. As for circuit obfuscation, if one-way functions exist, then $\epsilon$-approximate obfuscators do not exist.

% Applications: types of encryption...
We could consider these negative results as the byproduct of small issues in our definition of VBB. In \cite{VBB-imp} the authors show this is not the case and that there is something inherently flawed in the idea of "Virtual Black Box". Maybe, despite these general impossibility results --- they suggest --- we can still obtain obfuscation for specific applications. Unfortunately this is not the case. They consider applications such as: signature schemes, private-key encryption, pseudorandom functions and message authentication codes. They prove that, if each of these primitives exists, then some instances of them must be "unobfuscatable".
Finally they show that, conditional to Decisional Diffie Helman being "hard", there exist families of low-complexity functions (i.e. computable by $TC_0$ circuits) that are unobfuscatable.
Later \cite{VBB-imp-aux} presented other impossibility results on VBB obfuscation proving its impossibility for adversaries with auxiliary inputs.

% Watermarking
Another consequence of the results in \cite{VBB-imp} is the impossibility of general \emph{(fragile) watermarking} algorithms \cite{collberg2002watermarking}. 
Watermarking is the problem of marking an object in a way that it would be hard to remove the mark without inevitably ruining the object. \cite{VBB-imp} presents two definitions of watermarking and prove their (conditional) impossibility, building on the previous results on VBB obfuscation.
