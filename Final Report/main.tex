\title{Obfuscation: Impossibility Results and Applications}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this report we discuss some major results in the area of obfuscation. In particular we show that VBB obfuscation is impossible, and that a weaker definition of obfuscation, called \emph{indistinguishability obfuscation} (IO) can lead to constructions of several important cryptographic primitives. In short, IO guarantees that the obfuscations of two functionally equivalent programs are indistinguishable. Here we show how we can use IO together with one-way functions to create a secure two-round MPC protocol as well as a deniable public-key encryption scheme. Last, we show how we can use functional encryption in order to create IO.
